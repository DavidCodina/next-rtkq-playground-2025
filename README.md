# Next.js RTK Query Playground

This project is split into two main folders: client and server. Each runs independently, but the client expects the server to be running in advance. The client is built with Next.js, Typescript, Redux, and Tailwind. The server is a dummy json-server. Both the client and the server apps should be opened in their own Terminal window.

# server

Rather than using Next.js server features, this app connects to an external json-server.

# client

The client implements a contacts list with CRUD UI. Basically, this is just a setup for experimenting with various RTKQ features.
