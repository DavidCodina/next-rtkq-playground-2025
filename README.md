# Next.js RTK Query Playground

This project is split into two main folders: client and server. Each runs independently, but the client expects the server to be running in advance.

# server

...

# client

The client implements a contacts list with CRUD UI. Basically, this is just a setup for experimenting with various RTKQ features.
