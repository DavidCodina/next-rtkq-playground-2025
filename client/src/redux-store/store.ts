//
// ⚠️ Important!
// The docs have a different approach for Next.js in which they create a makeStore()
// helper that allows them to create a redux store per request. This helps mitigate
// hydration mismatches, but it's also prevents security concerns.
//
//   https://redux-toolkit.js.org/usage/nextjs
//   https://redux-toolkit.js.org/usage/nextjs#creating-a-redux-store-per-request
//
// ❗️ Using a global Redux store singleton (i.e., export const store) is sometimes
// considered a bad practice, but why? AI:
//
//   "Server Concurrency: Next.js servers can serve multiple, independent users at once. If you use a global store,
//   data from one user/request can appear in another user/request, causing data leaks and security issues."
//
// What the docs actually say:
//
//   - No global stores - Because the Redux store is shared across requests, it should not
//
//   - Per-request safe Redux store creation: A Next.js server can handle multiple
//     requests simultaneously. This means that the Redux store should be created
//     per request and that the store should not be shared across requests.
//
//   -  if you define global variables (like the Redux store) they will be shared across
//      requests. This is a problem because the Redux store could be contaminated with data from other requests.
//
// So... Is it really bad? The security concern is actually only relevant for
// Server-Side Rendering (SSR), not client-side Redux state. But wait... Isn't
// react-redux and all its hooks a purely client-side library. Yes. However, the
// underlying Redux store (from @reduxjs/toolkit or plain redux) is just JavaScript
// and can run on the server.
//
// Conversely, on the client side (in the browser), each user has their own JavaScript
// context. There's no way for one user's browser Redux state to leak to another user's
//  browser - they're completely separate environments.
//
// Why makeStore() is still recommended:
//
//   - SSR Isolation: Creates fresh store instances for each server-side render
//   - Hydration Consistency: Ensures server and client start with the same initial state
//   - Clean Architecture: Avoids potential memory leaks in server environments.
//
// Conclusion: The security language in the Redux docs is a bit alarmist and
// overstated. We could technically still use the store singleton approach here.
// This is a client component after all. However, the mitigation of hydration
// mismatches is still a major benefit.
